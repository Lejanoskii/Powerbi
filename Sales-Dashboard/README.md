## 🔍 Insights

- Both in 2013 and 2014, October recorded the highest profit levels, confirming a strong upward trend during the last quarter of each year.

- Despite being a typically strong season, December 2013 underperformed compared to October and November, suggesting a potential disruption in promotions or inventory availability.

- Q4 of 2014 reached the highest sales volume in the entire period, reinforcing a recurring seasonal pattern where year-end holidays boost sales performance.

- Government is the segment generating the majority of total profit, especially concentrated in Canada and Europe; this heavy dependency on a single segment represents a strategic risk if government demand fluctuates.

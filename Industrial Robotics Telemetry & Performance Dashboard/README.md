# 🤖 Industrial Robotics Telemetry & Performance Dashboard

An advanced industrial analytics dashboard developed in Power BI, focused on robotic telemetry, mechanical performance, and operational monitoring, using data integrated from a MySQL database to simulate near real-time industrial environments.

This project consolidates task execution data, mechanical telemetry, and robot performance indicators into an interactive analytical solution, enabling engineers and analysts to evaluate system behavior, identify bottlenecks, and support decision-making in industrial automation and mechatronics contexts.

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard was designed to analyze how industrial robotic systems behave during production, combining operational execution logs with mechanical telemetry such as speed, acceleration, and joint torque.

The solution is structured around a star schema data model, separating fact tables (task execution, movement telemetry, torque readings) from dimension tables (robot models, tasks, calendar), ensuring scalability, performance, and professional data modeling practices.

## 1️⃣ Mechanical & Performance Analysis

- Speed trends over time;

- Acceleration comparison across robot models;

- Average joint torque by robot and year;

- Mechanical load evaluation and temporal behavior;

- Cross-model performance comparison.

## 2️⃣ Detailed Logs & Telemetry (Drill-Through)

- Detailed task execution history;

- Movement telemetry logs with timestamps;

- Joint-level torque readings;

- Interactive investigation by robot, task, joint, or date;

- Designed for troubleshooting and root-cause analysis.
